# Documentation Instructions (docs/, README.md)

### Goals
- Keep docs aligned with repo reality (paths, commands, file names).
- Prefer short, actionable sections + copy/paste commands.
- Avoid aspirational claims. If a feature is stubbed, say so.

### Required updates
- CLI changes → update README/docs.
- New pack/extension → update `docs/PACKS.md` or relevant doc.
