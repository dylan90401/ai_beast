# dify (stub)

This is a **stub extension** for Dify.

- Purpose: reserve the service name/ports and provide a predictable placeholder in the compose graph.
- Status: **NOT a real Dify deployment yet**.

When you decide to make this real, replace this extension with an upstream Dify compose (multi-service) and wire persistence + secrets.
